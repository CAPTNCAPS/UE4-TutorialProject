# Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial Project (2017)

This project includes all the files I created for the video tutorials on my Youtube Channel "DasCapschen" from 2017 onwards. 
Each Tutorial does have it's own folder inside "Content". One exception to that are the C++ projects, who will most likely share a few classes (like the player class)
Files used in multiple tutorials are found in the "shared" folder.
