# Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial Project (2017)

This project includes all the files I created for the video tutorials on my Youtube Channel "DasCapschen" from 2017 onwards.   

### File Organization

Each Tutorial does have it's own folder inside "Content". One exception to that are the C++ projects, who will most likely share a few classes (like the player class)   

Files used in multiple tutorials are found in the "shared" folder.   

### Compatibility

Please note that this project is only compatible with Unreal Engine 4.16 and above. If you wish to use it in UE4.15 or lower, please revert commit b4836e5ac699a9c92592f6574ef25aedf1707564    

Please keep in mind that I will not provide support for any UE4 version that is different from the one I am using (at this time 4.16) as changes to the Engine itself are likely to be the issue, and not the code itself.
